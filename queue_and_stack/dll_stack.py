        # Why is our DLL a good choice to store our elements?

        # As I mentioned below, stacks operate on a LIFO basis. So when we add an item to the stack it gets added 
        # to the top of the stack (the head) and when we remove an item from the stack it gets removed from the top (the head).
        # Our DLL is a good choice to store our elements because insertion and deletion are fairly inexpensive in terms of 
        # time complexity. For example, to implement the pop method and remove the item at the top of the stack, we just need to
        # set the second item in our DLL's 'prev' attribute equal to none and delete the head node.
        # Inserting at the top of stack (pushing) is similarly as inexpensive - it's just a matter of readjusting the reference pointers.
        # If we contrast this with using an array as our method of storage, for example, if we are to implement the pop method and remove the item at
        # the top of the stack, the index of every item after that item would have be adjusted (decremented by one because we've just removed the 0th item).
        # Same applies to pushing - if we are to insert an element at the top of the stack (at the zeroth index), the index of every item after that will have to be 
        # incremented by one.
        self.storage = DoublyLinkedList()

    # Because stacks operate according to Last In First Out ordering, 
    # the push method will add the item to the top of the stack and increment the size of the stack by one.
    # Like a stack of plates in real life, when you add a plate to the stack, you add it to the top.
    # This can be done by calling the add_to_head method in our DLL class, passing in the value we want to add.
    def push(self, value):
        self.storage.add_to_head(value)
        self.size += 1

    # The pop method will remove the item at the top of the stack (the item that was 'last in')
    # and decrement the size of the stack by one.
    # If you had a stack of plates in real life and wanted to remove one, you'd probably remove it from the top of the stack.
    # This can be done by calling the remove_from_head method in our DLL. 
    def pop(self):
        #Â If the size of the stack is less than one just return from function 
        if self.size < 1:
            return
        # else decrement size of stack by one and remove the first item in the stack by calling the remove_from_head function
        # in our DLL class
